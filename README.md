# My process

## Built with
* Semantic HTML
* CSS

# Continued development
BookWise will be further styled, to be more attractive, user-friendly and responsive across devices.
Also, further JS logic will be integrated to the code to make for an option to get books and bring together people with shared interest in reading across their favorite genres.
